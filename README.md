# Simon-Says-Game
A simple frontend implementation of the classic Simon Says memory game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project recreates the Simon Says game where players must repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors. The game tests memory and reaction time with a clean and interactive UI.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.  
2. Watch the sequence of colored buttons light up.  
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.  
4. The sequence grows longer each round â€” keep going as long as you can!  

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Vanilla JavaScript  

## Setup Instructions

No build tools or dependencies required. Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser to play.
